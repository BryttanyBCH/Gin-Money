Welcome to Gin Rummy, By Nathan, Bryant, and Will for UNC Charlotte's ECGR 2104.
Play Gin Rummy by gathering runs (cards within the same suit that have an ascending number value, like 9-10-J-Q-K)
and sets (cards with different suits but the same number on them)
Each turn, the player gets to pick which deck they would like to take a card from:
the trash deck, where you can see which card you are getting, and the stock deck,
where the player doesn't know what they'll get.

After you pick a card, enter the card's number (0-10) to choose which card you
would like to put into the trash deck. You can choose to knock if you feel like 
you have enough melds--knocking means that you're ready to see if you have more
melds--and more importaintly, less deadwood--than your opponent. The AI can also knock, just like you.

If you knock with 10 cards in melds, you go "gin" and gain bonus points.
If you have 11 cards that are all in melds, you have gone "big gin" and recieve
even more bonus points. If you knock normally, you earn points for the point value
difference of your deadwood--non-meld cards--vs your opponent's deadwood point count.
Whoever hasn't knocked will have the chance to lower this defficite in deadwood, however.
Deadwood cards will get transfered to the knocker's hand to reduce the non-knocker's
deadwood count, reducing how many points that the knocker earns.

Have fun!
