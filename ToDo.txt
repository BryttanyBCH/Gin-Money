- Gin and Big Gin
    After a player takes a card, look at their deadwood count with countDeadWood().
        If countDeadWood()-=0 right after they take a card (they have 11 cards in cardsPosessed,) then they have Big Gin, and the game should knock for them and give them 31 points
        Else, keep playing
    If a player knocks normally (after putting down a card) and countDeadWood() == 0, then that means they have gone Gin, and they get +25 points
    In neither Gin nor Big Gin will the opponent's deadwood, or stealing of deadwood, be factored in, it is just a straight point grab

- Go back through the code and make everything look nice, and make sure you understand it all
    For example: make it so that the method to print a player's hand doesn't have "debug" in it
